# Lyfta Take Home Challenge

## The Challenge:
### This challenge has been completed as part of Lyfta's Software Developer Apprentice application process.
The objective of the challenge is to start building a video player and focus on a specific user story. Issues should also be raised for other user stories that could also be taken into consideration when building a complete video player.


## My user story of choice:
I have chosen to focus on building the progress bar that will indicate to users how far they've progressed in the video and how much of the video is left. To achieve this, I focused on:
- [ ] A clear, simple design that will allow users to easily identify the purpose of the element. 
- [ ] Contrasting colours so that the progression of the video is made clear as it transitions from grey to red. 
- [ ] The progress bar animation starts when the user plays the video (by clicking on the play button).


## Styling
I kept the design simple so that the function of the element is recognised by as many users of different ages/backgrounds as possible.
I also used contrasting colours for accessibility purposes.
